            <p>This is some placeholder text until I figure out what to actually say here!</p>
            <br>

            <p>I should probably say that I'm a game and web developer.  And somehow resist the urge to use words like "aspiring" or "fledgling".</p>
            <br>

            <p>This is a good spot for me to add a link to something I've worked on!  Hopefully the Wordpress-based site that I will somehow get up and running in the next three days.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Then the documentation example unless I come up with something else to say?</p>
            <br>

            <p>Then maybe something about that Ethical Design pyramid, like Sander had on their site.  That was cool!</p>
            <br>

            <p>And maybe finally something about my design philosophies?  Something about the intersection of form and function.  Or something about creative logic and logical creativity.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Sure would be good if I had any presence on social media.  But so much for that.  I will just close with a simple thank you for reading.</p>
