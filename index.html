            <p>I am a game and web developer, with an Associate's degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/" target="_blank">Tompkins Cortland Community College</a>.</p>
            <br>

            <p>As a game developer, I work primarily in Unity with C#.  For web development, I have experience with Vue and WordPress.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I believe in <a href="https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/" target="_blank">Ethical Design</a> and that the form, function and impact of technologies are at their best when they don't come at the cost of one another.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I take joy in development as an opportunity to express creative logic and to never stop learning.  I am always looking to expand my horizons, whether with a new platform, language or perspective.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Thank you for your time and for taking an interest in my work.</p>
